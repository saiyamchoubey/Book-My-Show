# Problem Statement

Managing movies, theaters, seats, and bookings in a large-scale ticketing system is a complex task.  
Traditional manual systems or poorly designed software solutions often lead to challenges such as:

- **Inefficient Booking Process:** Users face difficulties in booking tickets quickly and reliably.  
- **Limited Seat Management:** Lack of proper seat allocation and availability tracking.  
- **Scalability Issues:** Difficulty in handling a large number of concurrent users and bookings.  
- **Poor User Experience:** No personalized booking history, seat selection, or notifications.  
- **Admin Overhead:** Manual management of movies, theaters, and schedules consumes time and effort.  

To address these challenges, this project aims to build a **Spring Boot-based backend system** that provides RESTful APIs for efficient ticket booking, seat management, user authentication, and notification handling.  
The system ensures **scalability, reliability, and ease of integration** with client applications like web or mobile platforms.
